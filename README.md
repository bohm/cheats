### a cheat sheet collection for computer science

This collection of TeX-based cheat sheets was creating during my (ongoing) stay
at the Charles University in Prague, where I study computer science (I am
currently a PhD studying approximation and online algorithms).

The goal is to create a compact reference for individual courses (or final exam
topics) so that people who have already studied the subjects can re-learn the
essentials quickly. The secondary goal is to help memorization of the necessary
bits of proofs so that a smart reader can generate the entire proof during an
exam.

My goal is to have all cheat sheets in English, so that they will be useful
to the most people. Historically, some cheat sheets are still in the Czech
language; I will try to translate them in time.

The PDF files are hosted at my university page, and will be linked below.
